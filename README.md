# CSSI Final Project

# Squidward Run

The playerâ€™s goal is to get as many Krabby Patties as they can to get a high score. The player must press the spacebar to make Squidward jump to avoid the rocks that are coming towards him and to capture the Krabby Patties. If Squidward hits the rock then the game is over.
